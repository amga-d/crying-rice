# The Lesson of the Rice - Animation Project

## Project Overview
**Title:** The Lesson of the Rice  
**Runtime:** 2.5 minutes (150 seconds)  
**Platform:** Processing (Java-based creative coding environment)  
**Target Audience:** Children and families  
**Theme:** Food appreciation, empathy, and understanding the value of hard work  

## Project Requirements & Constraints

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework:** Processing (.pde files)
- **Performance:** Optimized for smooth 60fps animation
- **Resolution:** HD 720p (1280x720) for optimal performance
- **Audio:** Synchronized narration and background music
- **File Structure:** Modular scene-based approach for maintainability

### Creative Requirements
- **Art Style:** Simple, colorful, child-friendly 2D animation
- **Character Design:** Little Joko (main character), Mom, Farmer, Friend
- **Environment Design:** Field, Home kitchen, Bedroom, Rice field (sawah)

### Performance Optimization Strategy
1. **Scene-based modular development** - Each scene as separate class/module
2. **Asset preloading** - Load images and sounds during setup
3. **Efficient rendering** - Use object pooling for repetitive elements
4. **Memory management** - Clear unused objects between scenes
5. **Frame rate consistency** - Optimize drawing calls and animations

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Project planning and scene breakdown
- [x] Basic Processing setup and project structure
- [x] Asset planning and style guide creation
- [x] Audio timing and synchronization planning

### Phase 2: Scene Development (Sequential)
1. **Scene 1 Implementation** - ✅ COMPLETED - Complete field scene with characters
2. **Scene 2 Implementation** - Home kitchen sequence
3. **Scene 3 Implementation** - Dream sequence with special effects
4. **Scene 4 Implementation** - Night bedroom scene
5. **Scene 5 Implementation** - Resolution and ending

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish

### Core Classes
- **SceneManager:** Handles scene transitions and timing
- **Character:** Base class for all animated characters
- **AudioManager:** Synchronizes narration and music
- **Scene:** Base class for individual scene logic

## Success Criteria
1. **Smooth 60fps performance** throughout entire animation
2. **Accurate timing** with 2.5-minute runtime
3. **Emotional engagement** through character animation
4. **Clear storytelling** conveying the rice lesson theme
5. **Professional quality** suitable for educational use

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Scene 1 implementation
2. Establish character animation system
3. Create basic scene transition framework
4. Implement audio synchronization
5. Iterate through each scene systematically
